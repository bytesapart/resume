## Resume
A simple template in Latex, loosely based off of a Microsoft Word template called "The Parker" as featured in "The Tech Resume: Inside Out" by Greg Orosz. This repository consists of both OnePage as well as TwoPage resume. It's largely catering to my own needs, but the LaTeX files can easily be modified by anyone who is interested in using this template.

The template is heavily documented in the form of comments, and can easily be modified.
